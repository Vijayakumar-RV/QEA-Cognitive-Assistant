            **Task:**  
            Given the user request and the following context, retrieve and present the relevant user story as clearly as possible.  
            - Use only the information provided in the contextâ€”do NOT invent or hallucinate user stories, requirements, IDs, or acceptance criteria.
            - If the exact user story (by ID or description) is found in the context, present it using this format:

            User Story ID: <ID>
            Title: <Title>
            Description: <Description>
            Acceptance Criteria:
            - <Criterion 1>
            - <Criterion 2>
            ...

            - If the user story is not found or the context does not include a match, reply exactly with:  
            "No matching user story found for the request."

            - Do not summarize or rephrase unless explicitly instructed.  
            - Do not generate new user stories or IDs.
