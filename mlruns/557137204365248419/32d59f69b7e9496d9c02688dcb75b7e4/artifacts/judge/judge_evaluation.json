Critical acceptance criteria from US-09 (valid credential login, invalid login error message, successful redirect to My Account) are not covered. Missing items: explicit test cases for valid login, invalid login, and successful redirection; concrete test data (username/password); expected messages or assertions for failure/success; postconditions (e.g., user is logged in, account dashboard shown); negative and edge cases (locked account, empty fields); automation-friendly steps with clear locators and verification steps. Formatting is acceptable (readable Markdown-like), but steps are presented as dictionaries instead of a consistent step/action/expected result table. Suggested improvements: add at least three additional test cases: (1) Valid Login \u2014 supply valid credentials, verify redirect to My Account and presence of account elements; (2) Invalid Login \u2014 try incorrect password, verify error message text and no redirect; (3) Empty Fields \u2014 attempt submit with blank fields, verify validation messages. For each TC include preconditions, test data, exact locators, detailed step-by-step actions, expected results with assertions, priority, type (manual/automated), and postconditions. If automation is intended, include stable selectors and any setup/teardown steps."
