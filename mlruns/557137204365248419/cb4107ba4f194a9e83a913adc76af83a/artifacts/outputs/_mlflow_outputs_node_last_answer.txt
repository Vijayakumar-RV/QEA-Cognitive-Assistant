**Type:** Manual  |  **Priority:** Medium

**Description**  
This test case verifies that the 'Login or register' link is present and clickable on the landing page, allowing the user to proceed towards login or registration. Further steps for actual login (entering credentials, submitting form, verifying success/failure, or redirection to 'My Account dashboard') cannot be provided due to missing UI element details in the context.

**Test Steps**
1. Navigate to the Automation Test Store landing page.
2. Locate the 'Login or register' link in the Header section.
3. Click on the 'Login or register' link.

**Expected Result**
> The user is navigated to a page that presents options for either logging in or registering an account.
