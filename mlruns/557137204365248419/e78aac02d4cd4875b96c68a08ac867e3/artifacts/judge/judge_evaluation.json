Missing critical elements: concrete test cases (positive and negative), preconditions, step-by-step actions, test data, expected results, pass/fail criteria, mapping to acceptance criteria, use of provided locators/elements, and any formatting (e.g., test ID, priority, severity). To be acceptable, produce a set of test cases that at minimum: 1) cover successful login with valid credentials (include steps, locators, test data, expected outcome), 2) cover invalid credentials and expected error message, 3) cover blank fields validation, 4) cover password masking and show/hide if applicable, 5) cover account lockout or throttling if in scope, and 6) include navigation post-login (redirect to My Account). Prefer structured output (table, JSON array, or Gherkin scenarios) and explicitly reference the acceptance criteria. Re-run with those details."
